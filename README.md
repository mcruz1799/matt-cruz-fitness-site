This is a landing page created for Matt Cruz Fitness.

This page serves as part of a Sales Funnel to convert prospects into 1:1 coaching clients. 

The site was developed using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JS. 

I used the concepts of responsive web design to make the site suitable for web or mobile. 

The Slick Carousel library is used to create a moving carousel of client testimonials. 

CSS Flex Containers and Media Queries were used to structure the page and make it responsive.
