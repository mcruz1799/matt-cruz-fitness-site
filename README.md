This is a landing page created for Matt Cruz Fitness Coaching. It serves as part of a sales funnel to convert prospects into 1:1 coaching clients. 

The site was developed using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JS and was made responsive so it's suitable for web or mobile. 

Development highlights:
- Partials were used to make the code modular
- CSS Flex Containers and Media Queries were used to structure the page and make it responsive. 
- The Slick Carousel library was used to create a moving carousel of client testimonials.
